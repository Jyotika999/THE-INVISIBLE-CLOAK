# THE-INVISIBLE-CLOAK üòç :heart_eyes:
Being fan of HARRY POTTER in my childhood days, I was always a fan of how he used to disappear . I am gonna try the same here too using OpenCV and numpy.

 This is an interesting project using openCV library of python . So, basically the background is captured for some number of iterations to get the best part of the background image. Taking my cloak having a color of 'RED' , it gets detected and gets superimposed by the background image by making an illusion of " MAGIC ".


This uses the concept of color detection and segmentation. For making it much better , the concept of Morphological Transformations is used.
